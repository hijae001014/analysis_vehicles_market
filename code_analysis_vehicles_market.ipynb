    "#### In this report, we are going to analyze how the known electrical vehicles companies doing so far on in the market by analyzing stock price, revenue, number of emloyees, dividens, and computing ratios. The report is divided into three parts to compare the competitive ability of each company: 1. Earnings & Growth Analysis, 2. Ratio Analysis, 3. Other Metrics.\n",
    "- The Earnings & Growth Analysis contains data of revenue growth and changes of stock prices. The report will include graphs to visualization the comparations. \n",
    "- The Ratio Analysis contains Profitability Analysis such as gross profit margin and net income margin; Financial Health Analysis, such as debt to equity ratio, quick ratio; Valuation Analysis such as price-to-earning ratios, and in this part, it also contains a summary valuation analysis. At the last, we also conclude other maybe useful ratios such as ROI and return on tangible equity to see how these company doing financially. \n",
    "- The third part of this report showing other metrics, for exmaple, the number of employees hired by the company. The report merged all the dataframes in one block in order to compare the data more conveniently. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### By computing three parts of analysis, we are hoping to present a conclusion on which company may have better competitive ability in the electrical vehicles market currently. What's more, we are going to indicate suggestions on which company are more valuable to invest in the FINAL REPORT."

However, its historical revenue shows a shocking downward for twice. Compared to Tesla, Ford has a unstable changing on its stock price, but most recently, the trend is in an increasing shape. And its historical revenue is in a relative high range of amount. General Motors has a smoother increasing rate of change of its stock price. Its highest value is happened at Jan 2022 of 75.64 dollars. It's higher than the Ford but still has a big difference with Tesla. Similarly with its stock price, the historical revenue of General Motors is also smoothly changing expect only two shocks. Nio has similar highest value of stock price with General Motors, but the pricing is decreasing recently. However, oppositly, the historical revenue of this company is climbing upwards in a decent increasing rate. "
